# Notes

- HTTP is stateless and unidirectional.
- No way to push data from server to client unless(setInterval from client)
- WebSockets provide a persistent, bidirectional connection
- Both server and client can send data at any time
- Socket.io is a JavaScript library that abstracts WebSockets.
- It supports fallbacks for unsupported browsers.
- Support creation of rooms, namespaces, broadcasting.
